###       Differential Peak Calling Pipeline: by Lucas MT       ###
###################################################################

# Fill in this form to run the pipeline. Lines starting with ">"
# denote entries to fill (parameters). Entries must be written one per line.
# All entries must be filled in!

# Lines starting with '#' are for comments, they won't affect the script.
# Empty lines won't affect the script either.

########################## Input Data ###############################

# Samples go in pairs, sample 1 will be compared to sample 2

# Take special care in the order of the samples!
# If you want to compare the same sample more than once,
# you will have to write it as input again as necessary.

## Coverage files (track files), usually normalized by input, in '.bed/.gedgraph/.bdg' format.

## Other Inputs

# This must be a plain text file with the names of chromosomes and their lengths.
# One chromosome and it's length per line, separated by <TAB>.

####################### Settable Parameters #######################

# Folder for Outputs
>Out_folder
Difpeaks_Test_CDF

# Number of processors to use
>Threads
8

# Window Size, the window size used for coverage calculations and comparisons.
>Win_Size
100

# Step Size, step size used to advance the window. Must be <= to window size. 
# Set to step size = window size to generate non-overlapping windows (default).
>Step
100

# Minimum Probability Difference (between samples). This is the value
# that controls the stringency of the peaks called. Set it to higher values for less
# stringent calls (and vice-versa).
>MinProbDif
0.3

# Peak Merge Distance, peaks sepparated by <= than this distance will be merged together.
# Peaks are merged before deing filtered by length (next parameter).
>Merge
500

# Peak Minimum Length, peaks shorter than this distance will be filtered out. 
>MinLen
1000
